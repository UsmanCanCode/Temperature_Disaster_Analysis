<h2>Is Temperature Rising? Are There More Disasters In Recent Years? </h2>

<p>We performed a geographical analysis of the impact of climate change on the frequency and severity of natural disasters</p>

<p>Sourced multiple available dataset from kaggel for Global Tempearture And Naatural Disasters</p>
<p>The primary source of temperature data is from the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study. The data is provided in several files to cover viewing the data by city, major city, country, and state/province. 
The source for natural disaster was: Natural disasters from US declarations and geocoded disaster data from NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC). 
Also. pulled in a list of all cities around the world to serve as a foundation for city-by-city analysis.All available on kaggle</p>

<p> Task performed for the the Data Analysis Project:</p>
<ul>
  <li> ETL: Extacted and Sourced the Data into project</li>
  <li> Data Cleaning: Combined and Transformed Data</li>
  <li> EDA: Explored Data and Performed Data Analysis</li>
  <li> ML: Used ARIMA Model to Predict Trends</li>
</ul>
